IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE & DISCLAIMER INFORMATION<br><br>

The Qanary Newsletters are publications (the “Newsletter”) owned and published by the Company (the “Publisher”). The Publisher is not registered as an investment advisor, and relies upon the “publisher’s exclusion” from the definition of “investment advisor” as provided under Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and corresponding state securities laws.<br><br>

The Newsletter is a bona fide publication of general and regular circulation offering impersonalized investment-related advice and/or information to subscribers and/or prospective subscribers (e.g., not tailored to the specific investment portfolio or needs of current and/or prospective subscribers). The Newsletter’s commentary, analysis, opinions, advice and recommendations represent the personal and subjective view of the Publisher and are subject to change at any time without notice.<br><br>

The information provided in the Newsletter is obtained from sources, which the Publisher believes to be reliable, however, the Publisher has not independently verified or otherwise investigated all such information. Neither the Publisher nor any of their respective affiliates guarantees the accuracy or completeness of any such information.<br><br>

The publication of the Newsletter should not be construed by any subscriber and/or prospective subscriber as Publisher’s (i) solicitation to effect, or attempt to effect any transactions, or (ii) provision of any investment related advice or services tailored to any particular individual’s financial situation or investment objective(s). Subscribers do not receive investment advisory, investment supervisory or investment management services, nor the initial or ongoing review or monitoring of the subscriber’s individual investment portfolio or individual particular needs. Therefore, no subscriber should assume that his/her/its subscription serves as a substitute for individual personalized advice from an investment professional of the subscriber’s choosing.<br><br>

The subscriber maintains absolute discretion as to whether or not to follow any portion of the Newsletter content. Publisher does not offer or provide investment or implementation services, nor does it offer or provide initial or ongoing individual personalized advice (neither in person nor via the Internet). It remains the subscriber’s exclusive responsibility to review and evaluate the content and to determine whether to accept or reject any recommendation and to correspondingly determine whether any such recommendation is appropriate for a subscriber’s investment portfolio or strategy (of which Publisher has and expresses no knowledge or opinion). Publisher expresses no opinion as to whether any of recommendations contained in the Newsletter is appropriate for a subscriber’s investment portfolio, strategy, financial situation, or investment objective(s).<br><br>

The subscriber acknowledges that any past performance referred to in the Newsletter may not be indicative of future results and understands that any opinions contained on the Newsletter reflect the Publisher’s judgment exclusively as of that particular date. Therefore, no current or prospective subscriber should assume that the future performance of any specific investment, investment strategy (including the investments and/or investment strategies recommended on the Website or in the Newsletter) will be suitable or profitable for a subscriber’s portfolio, or equal historical or anticipated performance level(s).<br><br>

Each subscriber or prospective subscriber acknowledges and accepts the limitations of the Newsletter and agrees, as a condition precedent to his/her/its subscription to release and hold harmless Publisher, its officers, directors, owners, employees, advisors, affiliates, and agents from any and all adverse consequences resulting from his/her/its subscription. Neither the Publisher, nor any of its respective affiliates is responsible for any errors or omissions in any Newsletter.<br><br>

Changes<br><br>

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and they apply to all use of, and access to, the Service thereafter. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
